Hello My name is Kori Francis, I am a recent graduate from Western Illinois University. I studied Information Systems while I was enrolled, but it has been not much of an interest.
I've realised this quite late so now I'm struggling to get a job in that field, so I tookup the initiative to learn how to be a front end developer, in hopes to land a successful career in the field.
